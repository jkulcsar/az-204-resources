# AZ-204 - Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure

Resources for the AZ-204 exam by Microsoft. Based on comments from past test takers, it is best to study the Microsoft Learning path as a base, then expand to other options for more details. The Thomas Mauerer guide has good reviews online and the Pluralsight path can be beneficial given enough time.

The Whizlab tests can be gotten for as little as $5 on sale, which happens frequently, and provide at least four interactive practice tests that provide detailed explanations for every answer. If on a budget, the ExamTopics.com practice test will do fine, but isn't quite as interactive. I can't speak to the efficacy of the official Microsoft practice test from MindHub, since it has a hefty price tag on it.

Udemy offers several courses and practice tests, but I can't speak to their quality either. I have heard that some are not helpful, but their ratings on the site are excellent. _Note: Never buy anything full price on Udemy. There is almost always a sale going on, so just wait a few days for the next one if you can_.
